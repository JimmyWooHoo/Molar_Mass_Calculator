Molar Mass Calculator


	This program helps the user calculate the molar mass of a molecule. It stores all symbols of elements in the periodic table in a list, and it stores the atomic mass of each element in another list in the same order. It first asks the user how many elements are in this molecule, and the input will be stored to determine the number of iterations of the rest of the program. In each iteration, it asks for the symbol of the element, which helps access the atomic mass of that element which is stored in a list. Then it asks for the number of that element present in the molecule, which multiplies the atomic mass and add to the total molar mass. The program should also check if the user input is within the appropriate range and valid. If not, it should tell the user the input is invalid and require input again. Finally, the program asks if user wants to calculate more molar mass. If enter yes, then program goes back from beginning and iterate again. If enter no, program terminates.
